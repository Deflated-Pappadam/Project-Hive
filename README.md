## Problem Statement
Acknowledging the absence of incentives in traditional crowdfunding and donation channels, particularly limiting their appeal, poses a significant challenge, especially in the context of rural development. Rural issues often receive less exposure compared to their urban counterparts. Consequently, we aim to construct a system that attracts both contributors and innovators by emphasizing a more effective, incentive-based crowdfunding and donation platform. Our goal is to establish a system where contributors receive returns, whether monetary or other benefits, fostering a more inclusive venture. This, in turn, advances our mission to promote food, agriculture, and rural development to a broader audience, a goal nearly unachievable through conventional methods.

## Our SOlution
The key solutions that we provide are :
+ Via Donations(Charity):
                                     Our aim is to transition the current donation platform framework to a blockchain-based model. This ensures transparency and secure fund transactions, all at a significantly lower cost compared to traditional methods such as bank-driven transactions. Each donor receives NFTs representing their transactions, serving as a tamper-proof digital record or allowing resale for potential financial returns.

+ Via Crowd-funding(Small Scale business) :
                                             The contributors receive PDM (PappaDaM) credits proportional to their contribution made on business fund-raisers, usable for purchases in our marketplace, offering established businesses a channel to boost their sales along with it.
